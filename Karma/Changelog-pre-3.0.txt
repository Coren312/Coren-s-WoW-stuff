20080416: Added visible credits for original author Aveasau and "resurrector" Endareth, this AddOn is not *new* in the true sense, I was merely the last "official" co-author.

20080417 (v20400.2): Added additional column next to the list of people to display their Karma value.

20080418 (v20400.3): Added the Karma value column also in the list of people in the current party.

20080421 (v20400.4): >>
Changes:
- (implicit) /who-calls *finally* queue properly, i.e. the queue doesn't get stuck terminally when it once fails to get a reply
- myAddOns support slightly improved (+ help)
- "/karma qcachewarn": command to toggle the Questlog-is-partially-collapsed warning
- randomly selected members for "/karma update" (i.e. without a commandline argument nor current target): the process is more likely to succeed after it checked each place of the alphabet once
- clicking on a member with the middle mouse button executes an update request (without selecting the member actually)

Fixes:
- another correction at the multilingual front... (internal 'ClassID' is only updated, when 'Class' is known in the current locale)
- mouseover in memberlist shouldn't cough at "Unknown" anymore

Internal:
- .TOC is now UTF-8, allowing accented letters (the usual escape codes obviously don't work)
- reading the version from the .TOC file (always forgetting to keep the string in localisation.lua synchronous...)
- removed various return nil from Set* functions
- cut identical intro from helptext, injecting at output loop
<< (v20400.4): 20080421

20080502 (v20400.5): >>
Changes:
- a bunch of new values added, notably: Talent (so you can finally flag that paladin as tank, warrior as dps and shaman as healer!)
- UI: lots of changes, *still* trying hard to find a way to split the amount of information in useful groupings :/
- a dozen new commands waiting for a proper UI counterpart and help (try /karma checkclass Warrior and /karma showonline for some stuff that's on the TODO list...)

Fixes:
- longterm bug: when a *new* person (new to Karma) joined your group, tracking wasn't working until the group changed somehow (order, another join/leave)

Internal:
- two old unused values in DB get removed now
- the xml file is split in three, it got really unreadable large a long time ago :D
<< (v20400.5): 20080502

20080504 (v20400.6): >>
Changes:
- fleshed out a bunch of commands, changed command alts to altadd/altrem/altlist
- can add alts also with right-click menü in the Karma window, joins clicked member with currently selected member
- LFM window:
  - is now of *some* use
  - (and has a name, kinda)
  - sort there is always by "talent"
  - got a key binding, yay!
  - tooltip on left side also lists the alts as known
  - middle click on left side queues a /who-update request
- Minimap icon: when simpleMinimap et. al. returns a different shape than "round", the icon should end on the square border now
- looked over the old logic regarding pvp - entries, changed stuff around so the server is a part of the name for a cross-server entry

Fixes:
- some implicit fixes with the pvp and the internal changes

Internal:
- some initial code for AddOn communication: version, playerinfo (the latter yields a Karma "impression")
- many Karma_GetMemberObject replaced by Karma_MemberList_GetObject
- many times the same code as Karma_MemberList_GetObject replaced with call
<< (v20400.6): 20080504

20080505 (v20400.7): >>
Changes:
- tooltips for some helping info can be disabled now
- questcache warning can be disabled in option window now

Fixes:
- a correction with a fallout from internal changes in v20400.6
<< (v20400.7): 20080505

20080510 (v20400.8): >>
Changes:
- quests:
--- the "official" id can be scanned meanwhile via questlink-request, it displayed in the questlist, no more reliance on the non-unique quest names :-)
--- the "official" id is also added to existing quests by name, if they have no id yet
- semi-automatic storing of talents is in, but per default disabled right now
- LFM window:
--- new subwindow (button at the top right of the left list) to populate the list of players online
--- online in channel checks are now queued, so *all* channels can be queued via the new subwindow
--- %t in the message at the bottom gets replaced with the name of the player the message gets sent to
--- online checks over 30m ago get a different timestamp format to keep them readable

Internal:
- some more "local" variables
<< (v20400.8): 20080510

20080511 (v20400.9): >>
Changes:
- dateformat in frFR and deDE is now day/month/year instead of month/day/year
- sortby class now ignores gender if possible, i.e. each class is not anymore split up in two groups for male female
- tooltip in main Karma window now also on the party member list, slightly trimmed down

Fixes:
- talent checking should now work, you can de-/activate it with /karma autochecktalents
- sortby class is now more forgiving for broken memberlist entries
- version check now understands that 20400.10 is after 20400.9 (and not between 20400.1 and 20400.2)

Internal:
- some more "local" variables
<< (v20400.9): 20080511

20080512 (v20400.A): >>
Changes:
- main window:
-- skill: added a second, more simple model of A-F (1-6 for deDE) for skill level range
-- skill, gear/pve, gear/pvp: basic commands implemented, UI elements to come

- LFM window:
-- all people /who returned are now added to the list
-- completely changed the sort logic
-- added a minimal filter dialog
-- left list is now cached, so it doesn't have to be sorted again unless an entry is added or changed

- option window/Other:
-- new option to activate automatic fetch of talents

- option window/DB cleaning:
-- output of "dryrun" is now more sensible: first all kept entries (as Debug output), then all to be removed entries (into Secondary window)
-- "dryrun" now also has an UI element: in options/db cleaning there's a "test clean" button :-)

- as usual, more texts added than localized...

Fixes:
- main window:
-- questlist: external ID never made it into the right function (typo ftl), hopefully catched now

- version check:
-- should now finally actually work the way it should *crosses fingers*
-- price is, that it's now hexadecimal for a while to catch the "1 < 10 < 11 < .. < 2" logical error

Internal:
- Karma_MemberList_GetObject: new third arg, if many members are requested it makes more sense to request the list outside
- some more "local" variables (as always...)
<< (v20400.A): 20080512

20080513 (v20400.B): >>
Changes:
- main window:
-- Skill, Gear/PVE and Gear/PVP buttons now do something (useful)

- options window:
-- the button of the current category gets highlight-locked now

- LFM window:
-- filter: added a new option, Karma required (i.e. player must be in Karma's list)
-- filter: skill option is now a dropdown menu instead of a value

- Other:
-- update messages (<Player> updated, <Player> online) include guild now, if known
-- the window which asks if you really want to remove someone is a bit smaller now
-- if you join a group, the client sometimes gets "Unknown" for one player, and Karma then assigns wrongly... now re-assigns again after 10 seconds (until all group members are known)

Fixes:
- I messed up the scrolling ranges recently :-( now I read the documentation and fixed that again; on the bright side: lists don't seem to be half filled all the time anymore ;-)
- joining a group left the people still improperly updated (i.e. *not*), fallout from the code for pvp (multiserver capabilities), fixed now
- guild is NOT updated until you are close enough to the group member, because WoW doesn't send it properly for larger distances (cross-zone etc.)

Internal:
- some more "local" variables (as always...)
<< (v20400.B): 20080513

20080516 (v20400.C): >>
Changes:
- looots of localisation (pulled a billion strings out and added to deDE), all but Import/Export is currently localized
- commands: added "checkguild" (like other check* to look for players), removed "talent", "skill", "gear/pve" and "gear/pvp" (all via UI accessible)
- command: altadd now checks if the two given players are actually non-identical...

- minimap icon:
-- added middle-click which opens LFM window now (also mentioned in the expanded tooltip of the icon)

- main window:
-- right-click menu on memberlist: alt add/remove is not available on *selected* member, alt add now explicitly states to whom the right-clicked player is added (=> the selected one)

- options window:
-- new options in category autoignore (now auto. ignore/warn): warn on group member of group you just joined if below the (configurable) Karma threshold

- LFM window:
-- populate: added "Check for players of guild" option
-- filters: added by level, by talent (HPS/TANK/DPS/Melee/Range) and by class

Internal:
- removed a number of functions unused since ages
- streamlined Karma_AutoIgnore_Invites, Karma_GetConfigPerChar
- some more "local" variables (as always...)
<< (v20400.C): 20080516

20080517 (v20400.D): >>
Changes:
- tooltip: it is now configurable if skill/talent/alts are displayed
- right-click menu on Party/Target: return of the direct +4/+1/-1/-4 Karma changing (hooksecurefunc'd UnitPopup_OnClick)
- if you change target to a player known to Karma, and no member is selected (or the Karma window is hidden), Karma switches to that player as selected
- a warning was added, if other frames are registered for inspect messages (Karma doesn't fetch talents in that case currently)

Fixes:
- note creep: all functions that changed the current member were checked against properly switching the note also
- some checks for party members are now only done when they were newly added to the party

Internal:
- removed some double checks on invalid KARMA_CURRENTMEMBER
- some more "local" variables (as always...)
<< (v20400.D): 20080517

20080518 (v20400.E): >>
Changes:
- added a "virtual" splitter in the right-click menus of party/target to make it more visible that Karma options are additional
- *completely* rewritten talent fetch code, slower but reliable if multiple frames are registered and trying the same

- main window:
-- buttons at the Karma slider moved a bit more outwards and disabled at border values

Internal:
- some more "local" variables (as always...)
<< (v20400.E): 20080518

20080522 (v20400.F): >>
New:
- added infrastructure for 'virtual' Karma; 'virtual' Karma means, it's a value that is not stored on its own, but calculated on demand
- first 'virtual' Karma: Karma per total time played (see new category in options window)
-- players with non-zero 'virtual' Karma are displayed with a star next to the Karma value
-- TODO: possibility to enable/disable per player

Changes:
- various results of /who checks are now displaying in a way that you can right-click the playername to get the usual menu
- display of Karma values in chat windows: replaced <> with {}
- chat window markup: changed the * for "player has note" to + (because * is now a 'virtual' Karma notifier)
- colorization: as usually most players spread between 40 and 60 Karma, the colors are now a bit more "changing" in that range
- minimap icon tooltip: now displays the key bindings, if available
- normal tooltip: Karma value is now colored according to the... Karma value :D

- main window:
-- shift-left-click on party-/playerlist now opens the Chatline with /whisper <player> in it
-- tooltip on players with non-zero 'virtual' Karma has additional information about that
-- added a [?] (Help) to the playerlist to show what you can do there (ever noticed middle-click?)

- option window:
-- 'virtual' Karma category added
-- minimap icon: added option to hide it (in Other)

- LFM window:
-- time since check: "> **m" was too wide, cut to "**m"
<< (v20400.F): 20080522

20080525 (v20400.10): >>
New:
- every instance you visit should now be recognized, the region and its zones marked as instance; this will be visible in the LFM window as the instances got the color blue (raid instances got purple and pvp instances got red)
- every instance you visit with someone gets now tracked in a new substructure, if you hover over the region in the zonelist, you should see the results
- every player's GUID is now tracked, if the GUID changes, the player is *not* updated (i.e. assuming that the char was deleted and newly created, so not the one you once played with)
- if not in an instance, tracking the most recent 25 players (both factions!) you moused-over (there's no way to display that list thru regular commands or buttons yet though)

Changes:
- zonelist: zones have been sorted by regions since some while; format changed: there's one region entry (without zone) and the zones got the region name removed and a hyphen added in front
- questlist: similar to zonelist, only that questlist *wasn't* sorted by region before (is now)
- version information: it should now only show once per session that there's a newer version (for every newer version you encounter that is...)

Fixes:
- menu on playerlist: remove from alt list is now displayed always (in contrast to add to alt list, which is only shown if a member is displayed and another clicked)
- low Karma warning: this was accidently propagating the wrong name, i.e. always the last member of the group; should now actually warn with the right name
- zone tracking: the timer to avoid *too* many calls of zone tracking that I added at some point in time was almost *too* successful... zone tracking should now actually work again :D

Internal:
- Karma_OnEvent: moved the more common events up, less common down the test chain
- renamed all the DB access variables into a different hierarchy, hopefully nothing went wrong :>
- added lists to replace a dozen Karma_<ConfigBla>_<OnLoad/OnShow/OnChange/On...> into three with logic, didn't write those three yet though ~
<< (v20400.10): 20080525

20080526 (v20400.11): >>
New:
- shift-click in the questlist on quests with external id gives you an URL to copy in your browser to lookup the quest (at allakhazam)

Changes:
- region log: updating the total time now, and showing it

Fixes:
- questlist/zonelist: forgot to count the added region lines to the number of total lines; fixed
- version check was *still* not correct; fixed
- LFM window: showed tooltip for the wrong player on the right list; fixed

Internal:
- removed some empty functions
- tooltip is in some places now generic and table-driven
<< (v20400.11): 20080526

20080602 (v20400.12): >>
(Should have released a version in between. Added lots of stuff, might've broken something. Bug reports are welcome!)
New:
- new menu in main window: defaults to your current char, chooses to which of your characters the data is related which is displayed about the selected player
- new checkboxes "R"/"Z"/"Q" - show/hide the related lists
- new list in Karma main window: region list - shows region/difficulty/dates information
- new command: mouseover - lists the most recent 25 people you moused-over (only tracking outside instances)
- new commands: xinfo/xnote/xupdate - for people who play on both sides, to see if you know that person and change their entry
- new commands: forcenew/forceupdate - if Karma thinks that there's a collision and refuses to update a player to either force it to backup the current entry and add a new one or overwrite the current entry
- new option: tracking for daily quests can be disabled

Changes:
- command: "help quick" is now sorted
- Karma is much more careful about updating a player, checking if that is actually (probably) the same player, on trouble use the forcenew/forceupdate commands

Internal:
- quest-/zonelist: entries are now created OnLoad
<< (v20400.12): 20080602

20080607 (v20400.13): >>
New:
- added a level-relative display (and internal fields) for xp-together data

Fixes:
- bug on players with missing time-together data fixed
<< (v20400.13): 20080607

20080608 (v20400.14): >>
New:
- main window (second "tab"): alt list of selected player, names are clickable to switch to the alts
- option window (other "tab"): update while afk, if enabled, does the same as /karma update when player is afk (and has no target)

Changes:
- the played time for a character now sums only time in parties, i.e. times of soloing are excluded
- when a collision occurs and Karma can't update a player, it now shows a bit more details about the conflict, the warning is not that red anymore and the name is clickable in the warning
- PostToChat - Button: (tried to) explain a bit more clearly how to fulfill the precondition for it
- LFM window: entries which are older than an hour are automatically deleted, unless they were added to the candidate list

Fixes:
- random selection of a player for /karma update preferred to update non-70 chars too much; fixed
- version check: check for "most-recently-seen version is newer than less-recently-seen version (which are both newer than the current)" is now... fixed
<< (v20400.14): 20080608

20080609 (v20400.15): >>
New:
- progressed in implementing data exchange on willing other Karma users (not yet useable though...)

Internal:
- locals, locals, locals (bulk of the change)
<< (v20400.15): 20080609

20080615 (v20400.16): >>
Changes:
- members with conflicting data are now more visible in the partylist and the left list of the LFM window
- /karma forcenew / /karma forceupdate: if there's a conflict, a context menu on party members and in LFM window on left side is available to choose how to fix it

Fixes:
- /karma forceupdate was clearing to harsh, messing up lists; fixed to the standard "level"

Internal:
- MemberName2UnitName: now preferring party* over other Unit-groups
- playing around with proper region/zone collation, the recently added region tracking forced some old, logical misconception to the surface that needs a closer look
<< (v20400.16): 20080615

20080622 (v20400.17): >>
Fixes:
- conflict check was incorrect for party members that got /karma forceudpdate'd

Internal:
- started to add racebygender tables
<< (v20400.17): 20080622

20080706 (v20400.18): >>
New:
- added KarmaTrans into the Karma - archive, now you can play around with the /karma exchange* - commands (use "/karma help quick" for a list of all commands)

Internal:
- still fighting with proper and sensible parameters for the integration of imported Karma
<< (v20400.18): 20080706

20080718 (v20400.19): >>
Fixes:
- checkbox for "message sent" is now also properly displaying for players which are not on Karma's list
<< (v20400.19): 20080718

20080824 (v20400.1A): >>
Fixes:
- Post to chat: Is now again able to whisper to your current chat target.
<< (v20400.1A): 20080824

20081012 (v20400.1B): >>
Changes:
- I started (a bit) ripping the huge monolithic source blob into smaller, more manageable files... As with changes of that type, it's complex to be 100% sure it went ok, that's why I waited a bit with publishing the (first) changes.
- if you open the social frame (Friends, Ignore, Who, Guild, etc.), pending /who-requests from Karma are now stalled to not interfere with manual interactions

Fixes:
- zoning: Hopefully the zone type is now more often correct. (The issue is that one cannot rely on the Blizzard calls to be sure that zone X is of type Y, because those two are updated seperately...)
- /who handling: should now not taint the social frame anymore (raid frames - not that any regular raider uses the standard frames, but it still annoyed me enough ;))
<< (v20400.1B): 20081012

20081018 (v30000.1): >>
Fixes:
- various adaptions necessary for new WoW interface version
<< (v30000.1): 20081018

20081025 (v30000.2): >>
Changes:
- Tooltip: without Shift, the talent tree names in the tooltip are cut to 4 characters (e.g. "feral combat" -> fera)
- Tooltip: new option to only show Karma info in normal tooltip when Shift is pressed (otherwise shows if info is available)

Fixes:
- Tooltip: the manually set spec is now added to the talent line in front of the tree info
- Tooltip and LFG window: colored texts should now terminate more properly (formerly it was sometimes blurring into following lines)
<< (v30000.2): 20081025

20081108 (v30000.3): >>
** Remember to backup your WTF folder regularly! **

Changes:
- Database:
  - the most common accented characters are now mapped onto the character closest to them (instead of onto 'A')
    => special exception: ß is mapped to B (!!), as that's the most common (ab)use I see in names (actually it should map to S, but who would find *that*? ;))
    => this made it necessary to increase the database version to let the new mapping apply automatically
  - now tracking the group when you enter a new area the *first* time ("Discovered: <Zone>" - message)
    (not yet displaying that anywhere; will add some marker in the zonelist)
- Popup menu on target frame:
  - added "add" and "remove" and a message to the +4/+1/-1/-4 changes if the target is not yet added
- Main window: Filter
  - added a new option "p-<pattern>" searches for pattern
    => this can be anywhere in the name: p-al finds Hale as well as Ale and Pal
    => the comparison tries to strip all the accents for the comparison: p-ego finds also Légôlas, Lègolãs and Léègôlâs
    => this is neither documented nor added to the filter-input-dialog yet

Fixes:
- not actually a fix, but I guess it confused plenty of people... searches are now trying to auto-capitalize
  => if you just type into the filter box, it should automatically convert the first character (or the character following the "n-" key) into a capital letter
  => this works unless Karma doesn't recognize it because the letter is not inside the scope of Latin-1
<< (v30000.3): 20081108

20081113 (v30000.4): >>
Changes:
- new-area-discovered tracking improved a bit
- added a bit more infrastructure for a public note (in addition to the current, private, note)
<< (v30000.4): 20081113

20081115 (v30000.5): >>
Fixes:
- discovering an area first time in a BG doesn't throw an error anymore (bug reported by Maischter)
<< (v30000.5): 20081115

20081116 (v30000.6): >>
Changes:
- added Deathknight at various necessary places
- Karma can now inject available information into the tooltip of the "regular" LFG tool (looks ugly, but works... :D see Options->Tooltip if you want to disable it)
- Click on an LFG-player/group posts all Karma related infos into the secondary window
- Shift-Click on an LFG-player/group selects the player with Karma in the Karma window (does nothing if two players with Karma are in the group already)
- regular party/target tip also reworked, should behave more definite now...
<< (v30000.6): 20081116

20081116 (v30000.7): >>
Fixes:
- safeguarded Karma against WIM calling SetOwner with wrong arguments... (bug reported by Maischter)
<< (v30000.7): 20081116

20081124 (v30000.8): >>
Changes:
- LFM-window: Class is now truncated at the first space to avoid it spilling into the role column (most obvious with frFR-"Death Knight")

Fixes:
- Karma is now aware that the max. level is 80...
- Death knight: Added missing entries for role matrices (Melee/Tank, Melee/DPS)
<< (v30000.8): 20081124

20081129 (v30000.9): >>
Fixes:
- Tooltip: missed a call to Show (to resize it to the additional info)
<< (v30000.9): 20081129

20090112 (v30000.A): >>
New:
- minimal WIM integration: added Karma to name in title of WIM tab (default: disabled, toggled with /karma wim_module)
- popup menus: new choice "select" to select a player into Karma's window (if known), also added to the chat window popup
- new command: "cleanpvp" to clean pvp entries (unless they have note or +/- Karma and you want to keep that)

Changes:
- "veryclean" command removed

Fixes:
- the Notes entrybox shouldn't try to force a maximum size anymore (didn't work anyways...)
<< (v30000.A): 20090112

20090118 (v30000.B): >>
New:
- popup menus: added choice "add to Karma" to the chat window popup

Changes:
- "select" in chat window popup now also scrolls to the selected member
- selecting in the party list in the Karma window should now scroll to the selected member in the member list

Fixes:
- the buttons in the confirmation dialog for deleting members have again a font... (bug reported by alchmo)
<< (v30000.B): 20090118

20090125 (v30000.C): >>
New:
- localization: TW (Taiwan), thanks to SuKai

(no other changes)
<< (v30000.C): 20090125

20090222 (v30000.D): >>
New:
- localization: TW (Taiwan) (is now actually pulled...), again thanks to SuKai

Fixes:
- Popup-Menu: adapted to under-the-hood change of Blizzard, should now work again
<< (v30000.D): 20090222

20090412 (v30000.E): >>
New:
- compatible with 3.1 dual-spec (at least on PTR)
- public note to share with 'anyone' (with Karma), share reach configurable with /karma shareconfig
- LFM window: people who were in the LFG-channel no less than 5 mins ago are marked green in the time

Changes:
- note in Tooltip and on-/who is now cut down to 5 lines max. (and 200 bytes max.)
- LFM window: added some more [?]-help
- Populate dialog: class check now initially starts with only class (i.e. all races) to fill up faster
- waiting up to twice as long to get any result when checking players in channel
- Populate dialog: not resetting fields/dropdowns after executing

Fixes:
- DK wasn't handled all that well in the LFM window
- missing class was white instead of grey in main list
- added two commands: forcecheck and altcheck to fixup missing code related to forcenew... (only executing the changes if additional argument 'execute' is given)
- command xinfo: failed to properly return in case that Karma didn't know the player
- version checking less spammy
