20090416 (v30100.1): >>
New:
- it is now possible to enable time/zone/quest tracking for the whole raid, see '/karma raid' for more information
- tooltip: added the option to display the time played together with the player (total time or time for the current character)
- public note:
  - when the player is in a guild, various hooked menus got an additional entry, this allows to collect the public note about a player in the guild
    (the public notes from others are currently NOT stored)
  - the public note is either spammed into chat if the player is not yet on your Karma list,
    or it is silently stored and you get it as tooltip of the <!> - area on the "Other data" page when you select that player

- new command to query about the public note: '/karma sharequery', this allows to query other audiences besides guild

Changes:
- on group changes Karma delays 10 seconds to let the Blizzard UI enter a sane state
- when trying to convert a name to a unit, raid is now also considered
- the public note request format was slightly changed on purpose to make it impossible to mine people with an older version who can't disable it...

Fixes:
- /who: stopped spamming debug output when the social frame is open...
- updating the DB from ancient versions was broken, fixed
- throwing a few bits around for sanity's sake...
<< (v30100.1): 20090416

20090423 (v30100.2): >>
New:
- autoclean pvp: this cleans Karma's list from cross-server people every time after you leave the BG (actually, after leaving the 'raid')
- shareconfig: you can set a data channel for Karma now
- sharequery: new audience '#' to query into the data channel you set with shareconfig
  (Karma won't use the channel *UNTIL* it saw any message in it! Say something in the channel to let Karma validate it)

Changes:
- tracking the whole raid is now on BY DEFAULT
- public notes: added a history
- forceupdate: now queueing an automatic update automatically after clearing the conflict
- regions that are added due to Blizzard's flakey update mechanism (entries with zero duration) are removed if older than one day
- LFG window: added raw talents to tooltip

Fixes:
- LFG window: checking channel doesn't forget the selection any longer
- selecting of which output of Karma shall go to which chat windows should work again
<< (v30100.2): 20090423

20090424 (v30100.3): >>
New:
- LFG window: button to (queue up) sharequery for all selected players
- sharequery: informant is now colored according to their Karma (if they have any)

Changes:
- sharequery: clearer error messages for #channel sending

Fixes:
- while integrating raid tracking, group tracking got partly broken... oops. fixed.
<< (v30100.3): 20090424

20090429 (v30100.4): >>
New:
- main window, "previous people" list: it's now possible to display some other lists there, e.g.:
  * raid history: raid compositions of the current session can be reviewed
  * mouseover: the /karma mouseover list is now a bit more accessible
- added an informational message if cross-faction data is waiting to be integrated
- Strand of the Ancients and Wintergrasp: now recognized as pvp zones

Changes:
- chat filtering: changed around stuff to get rid of the dirty hook into chatframes... (currently not enabled by default) :D
- version check in guild: now just checking if you got a guild, not if people are online besides you (Blizzard UI is sometimes misleading there)
- channel reset is only done when *custom* channels change
- if tooltip is online enriched with shift, Karma value itself is still immediately inserted
- if more than 5 alts are in the alt group, the tooltip should break it into two lines
- warning message for player-changed-race-or-class: player is now clickable also when he's in the group
- add and ignore commands: should now also use the level, race, class from the /who result
- localization: some strings were changed in a slightly non-compatible way (*UNITPOPUP*)

Fixes:
- various duration displays: showed hour at minute and minute at second... fixed
- self-character selection (show data for...) was sometimes flakey... partly fixed
<< (v30100.4): 20090429

20090504 (v30100.5): >>
Changes:
- mouseover list: clearer error message for not executed actions

Fixes:
- mouseover list: copy&paste error in query channel/guild... fixed
- chat filtering (new variant): the decision, if a channel is active in the current window, is made by code *after* the filtering... adjusted to that -- uh, logic?
<< (v30100.5): 20090504

20090507 (v30100.6): >>
New:
- sharing options got their UI part in the options window: channel got a default value, autojoin/-hide is off per default

Changes:
- more gear quality levels
- memberlist selections: mouse-seen is now third instead of last to keep it from shifting when you join/leave raids/bgs

Fixes:
- various pointless (and potentially harmful) code removed
<< (v30100.6): 20090507

20090507 (v30100.7): >>
Changes:
- LFG window filter: added deathknight
- LFG window filter: default level range now 1-80 (i.e. no filter by level)

Fixes:
- BG "raids": should now properly create raid history
- raid history: should now properly display the attendence for the selected raid 
<< (v30100.7): 20090507

20090508 (v30100.8): >>
New:
- added "query in channel" to the menus that already had "query in guild" (if you have a channel name set)
- added delayed 'self-test' of share-channel to enable it (if no other message happen before)

Changed:
- various commands that were queued and delaying other subsequent commands are now waiting "outside" the regular command queue

Fixes:
- name@server shouldn't blur outside the partylist/memberlist anymore
<< (v30100.8): 20090508

20090509 (v30100.9): >>
New:
- newer kind of chat markup has an option to enable it

Changes:
- right-click menu on cross-server entries: removed "invite" and "update"
- shift-click on cross-server entries: should now use name-server instead of name@server :)

Fixes:
- help: unset secondary window without any existing secondary window should now properly use the main window for output
<< (v30100.9): 20090509

20090520 (v30102.1): >>
Changes:
- workaround (by using a completely inappropriate function) to Blizzard's mind-boggling avoidance of GameTooltip.SetUnit() on players (the actual player graphic, not any unit frame)
- workaround to tooltip name colorization in hook of GameTooltip.SetUnit() (it gets lost for no inferable reason)
<< (v30102.1): 20090520

20090528 (v30102.2): >>
New:
- added switches to disable various types of tracking (because some people use Karma just as a fancy note keeper...), they still lack UI elements though
- implemented tracking for group-related achievements (PvP/Arena category, Dungeon&Raid categories -- missing: seasonal categories), but did not enable it yet per default (more internal testing for partial achievements wanted, because it must be deduced indirectly -- Blizzard sends events *only* for completely done achievements, not for progress)

Changes:
- options window is now on the standard UI page (Interface -> AddOns)
<< (v30102.2): 20090528

20090529 (v30102.3): >>
New:
- added two options to sort/color: time/xp summed across all chars of yours
- "Show total data" is now selectable and shows summed time&xp (only absolute values)

Testing: (only happens if you have beta switch enabled)
- started to change some db stuff: no more creating containers for each alt until the player joins that alt (this can reduce the database size considerably)
- some more stuff related to achievement tracking

Changes:
- sorting: is now always related to your current char, no matter what is selected on the "Show data related to..." menu
- /karma xupdate gives slightly more information about what it chose to do

Fixes:
- "Show data for ..." menu: the click area was pretty small, widened
- sorting: accidently added players twice in time/xp based sorting modes, removed duplicates
- sorting: corner cases (e.g. grouped for half a second) ended up at the wrong end, fixed
- "joined with current char" now really shows joined with current char, not with data-selected
- Signatures.txt: added missing .lua entries
<< (v30102.3): 20090529

20090530 (v30102.4): >>
New:
- if Karma is blocking target/focus, a dialog pops which allows now to deactivate Karma's context menu entries for those who prioritize 'target'/'focus' higher
- command '/karma tracking' for those eager to disable various tracking options

Fixes:
- some global taint removed (while trying anything to avoid the 'target'-taint issue...)
<< (v30102.4): 20090530

20090601 (v30102.5): >>
Changes:
- LFG window shift-click: if there is info, the name of the char is now clickable
- Post To Chat: cut down information to a smaller set (aggregated dungeons, removed private note, added public instead, removed "joined with")
- rewrote large portions of achievement tracking again
  * checking for partial progress much optimized, triggers straigthened
  * now also picking up selected world event achievements which are group-related

Fixes:
- showing notes on /who: often didn't display due to missing initialisation, fixed
- "Show data to" was wrongly displayed on the 2nd 'tab' of the main window since last version, fixed
- achievement tracking: missing local function in debug-output, fixed
<< (v30102.5): 20090601

20090604 (v30102.6): >>
New:
- achievement tracking is out of beta :-)

Fixes:
- ninja-change of Blizzard (FriendsFrame_OnHide went dysfunctional, making /whos of Karma block indefinitely when the frame was opened while a /who-query was in progress), work-around in place
- various stuff around achievement tracking fixed
<< (v30102.6): 20090604

20090609 (v30102.7): >>
New:
- Achievements: added shift-click (creates chat link) and middle-click (opens the selected achievement in Achievement UI)
- Filter dialog: added "name contains" and "joined after/before"
- Option window: category "Standard features" for people who want to disable various group tracking parts of Karma

Changes:
- should now also filtering GEM 3.x (pointlessly incompatible to GEM 2.x meta-format)

Fixes:
- some cleanup around the options window
<< (v30102.7): 20090609

20090617 (v30102.8): >>
New:
- if /who gets broken by Ace::WhoLib or similar, that should be recognized and the command queue be unlocked; there is also an initial warning and regular reminders to ask for a '/console reloadui'
- if you are in a pvp-zone, the time tracked there can now be ignored for VirtualKarma
- tracking the most recent change done to an entry (to get an age of an entry for a future additional database clean parameter), displayed in tooltip of Karma window
- added "select in Karma window" to LFM window right-click menu (formerly menu was just shown on conflicts)
- "total data": listing all regions for all chars (grouped by char)

Changes:
- achievement: linking should now insert into the chatline instead of completely overwriting it
- trying to fix the incorrect out-of-instance region entries
  - not adding current zone when player is a ghost
  - on zone change now forces the global map to be initialized
- LFM window: the green timestamp should now properly turn yellow when the person wasn't seen more than 5m in #LFG
- LFM window: color to zone assignment slightly changed (red=pvp, yellow=outdoors, turquoise=5-man, blue=10-man, purple=25-man)
- help has been split up into multiple parts
- random updates in background: entries with +conflict got a higher priority to be selected for update
- full exchange: delaying request according to received data
- WIM: should now work properly with newer chat version (filters instead of hook)

Fixes:
- scrolling to current member: the previous optimization was a bit too optimized... fixed
- achievement tracking: final completion for partless achievements wasn't properly tracked... fixed
- tooltip info for Blizzard LFG window was breaking alignment for groups... fixed
- Karma's LFM-window: now also regularly updating the list of selected players
- main chat window can now *actually* be set per char...
- removed some pointlessly created tables
<< (v30102.8): 20090617

20090622 (v30102.9): >>
New:
- an inferred talent spec is now used if the talent point distribution is known and one tree clearly dominates (> 40 points)
- added achievements from 'General' to track: levelling, money, needy, greedy

Changes:
- talent setting window: now displaying the points which the spec should be according to
- tooltip display of talents should now be the same in all tooltips: spec {points}

Fixes:
- LFM window: DK should now be sorted like a warrior; order of dps classes changed (dps/m (physical), dps/r (magic), dps/r (physical))
<< (v30102.9): 20090622

20090704 (v30102.A): >>
Changes:
- if possible, the exchange channel is already validated at joining
- the message for channel change should now appear even less frequently
- an empty database shouldn't loop any longer when trying to find someone to update while /afk
- setting the map to the current zone to get valid data isn't happening now when on a taxi, mounted or the map is shown
<< (v30102.A): 20090704

20090711 (v30102.B): >>
Changes:
- guessing of spec from talents now takes total talent points used into consideration instead of a hard >40 margin (for non-80 players)
- checking for class: now starts with no race and only explodes into check-per-race if that were too many
- checking for class: if a level range is given, too many results will also lead to more checks with smaller level ranges, with level 80 check split off first
- checking for class: some completion messages make a bit more sense now
<< (v30102.B): 20090711

20090716 (v30102.C): >>
Changes:
- shortened tooltip doesn't say "time" anymore, if the actual time is 0, nor "talents" anymore if they contain only specs with ?s
- changed the main sort routine a bit to be slightly more efficient
- slider: not anymore updating the memberlist on Karma change, if it's not sorted by Karma
- slider: only re-sorting when the slider has been let go (i.e. once, no sorting while moving)
- LFM: doesn't pointlessly update Karma window anymore while checking for players
- minimap menu: removed code to force expanding the first submenu to the left (because that killed the automatic aligning by the default UI)
- minimap menu: greyed options that do nothing for the current target
- minimap menu: added "separators" before the "cancel" option, moved "cancel" to the bottom if possible
<< (v30102.C): 20090716

20090721 (v30102.D): >>
New:
- a (not very pretty but working) LDB broker

Changes:
- DPS/? is now considered an indefinite spec (just like ???/R has been)
<< (v30102.D): 20090721

20090724 (v30102.E): >>
New:
- LFM window: added a button to show alts of people (on adding an alt and sending a message, the message is automatically sent to the main char)
- LFM window: on first opening, it now automatically adds online guild members and people in LFG channel (if you're LFG)
- LFM window: replaced talent spec texts where possible with the LFG window icons, for ranged dps some class specific icons are shown (but not class+talent specific, all mages get the same icon...)
- DB: sparse option available to make Karma use a bit less space at the price of a bit of user inconvenience
- Broker: added some mouse interaction, similar to the minimap icon

Changes:
- minimap menu: offset a bit to the topright to not overlay the icon (looks weird on minimap at the bottom :D)

Fixes:
- old chat markup was partially broken, fixed
- LFM window: in old chat markup mode, checking channels didn't work, fixed
<< (v30102.E): 20090724

20090726 (v30102.F): >>
Changes:
- localization: zhTW update from SuKai
- localization: zhTW merge-updated help from enUS
- localization: deDE updated help
- localization: changed all localization files slightly to allow easier automatic parsing (every key/value ends with a semicolon, every table entry with a comma)
- localization: added localization.<language>.missing.txt for missing translation keys in deDE and zhTW
<< (v30102.F): 20090726

20090727 (v30102.10): >>
Fixes:
- corrected reference to renamed function regarding talents in tooltips
<< (v30102.10): 20090727

20090731 (v30102.11): >>
New:
- sorting: new sort mode "by guild", groups players of same guild together, automatically adds a meta-entry for each guild on the memberlist (two sub modes, top puts the players without guild as the first block, bottom as the last block)
- addguild: manually adds a new meta-entry for a guild (only accessible in one of the "guild" sort modes), entry is colored bright green
- filter: new filter "by guild", prefix is "g-"
- broker: added a line with current length of command queue (with ctrl also the first 9 pending commands)

Changes:
- filter: changed to allow spaces in filters, if the filter value is encased in quotes (no quotes inside the value allowed), e.g. [i-"nice guy"] filters for nice guy in private notes
- Karma slider: now updates the current value "live" again
- forced update: modifies "last action" field with "update"+timestamp
- LFM talents: on identical values, only one spec should be showed and if that's text, centered (was missing for members)

Fixes:
- LFM: initial opening now *really* checks in LFG channel if you're in it
- LFM with alts: clicks/tooltips on alts are now properly working
- bug in initialization of conflict menu on LFM window fixed
<< (v30102.11): 20090731

20090810 (v30200.01): >>
Changes:
- .TOC bump for 3.2
- added categories for CotC - achievements (they were already recognized, this just avoids the message at login)

Fixes:
- still trying to get a consistent type (outdoor, dungeon, raid, ...) for zones (asynchronous updating of zone type and zone location is the core of this issue)
- dual spec: for known players, two ???-specs are now merged properly to one
<< (v30200.01): 20090810

20090814 (v30200.02): >>
New:
- minimap/LDB menu: now working off additional name sources (chat, raid members, mouseover) - a valid target overrides though!
- minimap/LDB menu: added "select in Karma's window"
- main window: added a "scroll to this char" button on the top right

Changes:
- chat/unit menu: default is now OFF (toggle in Options/Other), as X-Perl fixed the /focus issue
- markup: default is now the newer version (via filters)
- localization update for zhTW by Sukai

In progress:
- preparing to (ab)use the new builtin name by class markup (much less intrusive)
- colors for by time/by exp are quite hard to read depending on the chat window background, they will be replaced by brighter colors (or even be configurable)

Fixes:
- Karma shouldn't try to update cross-server entries any longer
- internal sort routine: better range check
<< (v30200.02): 20090814

20090817 (v30200.03): >>
New:
- color spaces for color-by can now be configured
- color spaces for color-by-time and color-by-xp have been changed slightly

Fixes:
- LFM window: toggling alts should now properly remove alts at all times
- options tooltips are now displayed in the place they'd be expected
<< (v30200.03): 20090817

20090825 (v30200.04): >>
New:
- sorting: added two new choice, by level and by level/all (sorts by *relative* xp, not absolute, so doing 30% in lvl 30 is similar to 30% in lvl 80)

Changes:
- sorting: should now be *much* faster for sorting by time/xp

In progress:
- still fiddling around with new markup code
<< (v30200.04): 20090825

20091011 (v30200.05): >>
New:

- sharing: levels are now properly displayed in the options window
- menu should now work properly also for targets from chat/mouseover/etc.

Fixes:
- issue with Wintertimer/WIM should be fixed
<< (v30200.06): 20091020

20091129 (v30200.07): >>
New:
- added achievement groups for 3.3 (ICC raids)
- added new filter "r-<instance>" (e.g. "r-Naxxramas")

Changes:
- LFG tooltip: not adding an extra line, instead the Karma rating (plus note notifier "+") are padded into the 'regular' line after the name
- "Test clean" button got a tooltip to reduce confusion

Fixes:
- corrected a long-standing issue with the checkboxes in the "Database cleansing" options
- added a number of additional updates to the cache that holds the main list
<< (v30200.07): 20091129

20091212 (v30300.01): >>
Changes:
- added instance "size" to region tracking
- quest type "log" is no longer tracked (typically, this is a "talk to $Foo" quest that's 'completed' when you get it)
- pvp areas are no longer tracked

Fixes:
- some issues around quest/region/zone tracking (hopefully) fixed
<< (v30300.01): 20091212

20091215 (v30300.02): >>
New:
- tracking the zone you see first after joining someone (to track pvp joins)
- new clear option to remove those who joined you first in pvp zones (defaults to enabled)

Changes:
- sharing: less spammy
- UI: replaced the two buttons for tracked/other data with tab buttons

Fixes:
- sharing: added checks for empty channel name
<< (v30300.02): 20091215
